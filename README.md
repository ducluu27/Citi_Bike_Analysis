## Summary

Overall based of the visualizations a bike-sharing program in Des Moines would be just as profitable as New York. Based of the results it shows that during the weekday at 5pm would be the peak hours to bike. I would recommend to add a visualization that shows the start and end location in Des Moines just to see where most of the bikers would be. Also, I would recommend adding a visualization of the gender and age of bikers in Des Moinse so that we can get a clear understanding of the population of the city.
